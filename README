| DESCRIPTION |
\------------/

This program calculates ion populations in homogeneous matter in thermal
equilibrium by solving the Saha-Boltzmann equation. Currently it only works for
hydrogen, but it can be extended to any mixture of atoms.

/-----------------------\
| SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES |
\-----------------------/

- Fortran compiler
- CMake

| COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS |
\--------------------------/

CMake writes Makefiles for you, so that you (and I) don't have to. Compiling is
simple:

    cd sb_solver
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Then use the included namelist (it expects the build directory to be called
"build" so you have to change that if you called it something else):

   ./run

The output is just a file with a bunch of columns of data. The first column is
the temperature in Kelvin. The rest of the columns are the ion populations.
